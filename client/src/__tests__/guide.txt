//TODO: a simple test consists of 3 parts:
// Rendering a component (render(<Component />))
// select a specific HTML element (getByLabelText, getByText, getByTestId, etc.)
// expect something about the selected element (expect(element).toBeSomething())

//TODO: What to test: (Behaviour, not implementation)
// test that main components render without errors
// test that the component renders with props
// test if the component renders in different states (conditional rendering)
// test that the component reacts to user interaction (click, hover, etc.)
// in general, make sure to test code that is relevant to user experience
